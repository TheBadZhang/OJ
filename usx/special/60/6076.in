In this paper, a new sort method of Kway insertion is put forward.
and its algorithmic ideas, and algorithmic description,
and its algorithmic analysis, and its experimental results is given.

The theoretical significance lies has the sort
time complexity is nlogn,
and it has nothing to do with data type and number range.
Its practical value is the sorting more efficiency,
the average sorting speed is quicker times
then straight insertion sort and quicker then shell sort.
